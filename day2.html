        <p>When I told my host I’m thinking of going for Top Tibba day hike, she seemed quite baffled. ‘You mean Lal Tibba?’ - she asked. Top Tibba is one of the less known hidden gems around Mussoorie. About 12Kms from the main Mall road, the trail to the Top Tibba starts Suakholi Market on Dhanaulti Road. If you are one of those who is always running away from crowds and concrete, then this is the perfect wilderness. Rohit (Rohit singh Nayak aka Mr Perry) was my guide for the hike and he was amazing.

<p>We set off on a scooter from the Mall road and in about 30mins, was walking up a narrow bouldery ascent. Two dogs - Jackie and an unnamed young one immediately offered their friendship. The unnamed one (lets call her Lucky - don’t ask me why!) was crazily happy. He was leaping all around, bumping against my stick, licking my shoes and trousers. ‘At this rate, either he will fall off the slope or I will.’ - I told Rohit while trying to balance on a boulder after Lucky suddenly decided to give me a happy bump. Jackie was more reserved, I must say.

<p>The route was not laid out. You basically make your own way through the ascent. (though there are a couple of other routes as well) As we ascended to the top, a very strong pungent smell of a wild animal became more and more prominent. Rohit started telling me all about wild bears and leopards and what to do and what not to do if we encounter them. Well, there was not much to do really, except pushing your luck! We discovered quite a few bear poop on the way but we both came to a conclusion, the smell was of a leopard. It kept coming and going as we got closer and closer to the top. It’s quite thrilling to imagine that a leopard was lurking in the jungle and keeping an eye on us the whole time. </p>
