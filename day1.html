        <p>As my Uber wheeled across the AJC Bose Flyover, I peeked out of the car window and I found myself grinning foolishly on my own. The street below the flyover - all along Nandan, Victoria, Maidan - has burst into a bright red flame - as if the rouge plumage of palaash just wished me luck on this venture.

            I had been toying with this idea of doing a solo unplanned trip for ages now. After a lot of dilly dally and taking a lot of deep breaths, I finally set off. So, here I am. At last, in Mussoorie - one of the pretty hillstations in India. After two flights and a long drive, I am safely tucked into a little cottage bed - feeling warm & cosy. The flights were curiously interesting. I met a very chatty, enthusiastic police inspector as my companion on the first flight. 2.5 hours went in a jiffy at the end of which, I was wiser by 2 chocolate cake slices and a mango juice. The second flight was pretty turbulent, a group of guys broke into a loud applause at the surprising event of landing alive.</p>

<p>The flight at Dehradun landed on a just rain washed runaway. As I got off the plane, a bright rainbow smiled from the corner of the mountain. Ah! I have missed mountains. You know the feeling of missing someone or something so bad that you miss them physically, like - the touch, the smell, the hold…I have missed all of that so much so long. But now I’m here with my chicken heart and lion dreams! Let’s see what tomorrow’s unplanned untravel unravels… </p>
